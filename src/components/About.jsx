                Hello! I'm Kunal, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science and
                Engineering student specializing in MERN stack web development.
                With a deep fascination for technology and a drive to innovate,
                I’ve been honing my skills in both web development and machine
                learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I’m exploring the dynamic world of web development
                using the MERN stack. I thrive on creating seamless, responsive
                web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. From
                crafting intuitive interfaces to developing robust backend
                systems, I’m committed to turning complex problems into elegant
                solutions.
